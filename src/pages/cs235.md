<!-- Rationale for changes: To add non-relational databases and their methods.
GRISMER: In general these MCOs are general enough to apply to what we do AND what they do on the main campus. What are we missing? I can see that the Topics only cover SQL we should add broad topic areas for NoSql -->

#### Description
This course offers in-depth study of database theory and concepts including data modeling, database design, normalization, and data integrity and security. Includes a survey of one or more modern database management systems (DBMS) and the underlying query language. Recommended: CS 110.

#### Intended Learning Outcomes
* Demonstrate knowledge of database fundamentals. 
* Demonstrate an understanding of data models.
* Create databases using different database models.
* Employ entity-relationship (ER) modeling.
* Construct effective Structured Query Language (SQL) queries.
* Construct effective SQL joins and MongoDB aggregation pipelines.
* Demonstrate an understanding of SQL and NoSQL DBMS.
#### Course Topics
* Database management systems (DBMS) and architecture
* The relational model
* Introduction to SQL and NoSQL; contrasts of SQL & NOSQL database operations for speed, updates, and scaling
* Table, document and graph type databases
* Methods of Node.js based Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) functions in SQL and NoSQL frameworks
* Database abstractions of application
* Building database agnostic abstractions
* Data normalization

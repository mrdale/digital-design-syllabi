<!-- Rationale for changes: To add non-relational databases and their methods.
GRISMER: In general these MCOs are general enough to apply to what we do AND what they do on the main campus. What are we missing? I can see that the Topics only cover SQL we should add broad topic areas for NoSql -->

#### Description

In-depth study of database theory and concepts including data modeling, database design, normalization, and data integrity and security. Includes a survey of one or more modern DBMS and its underlying query language. **Recommended: CS 110.**

#### Intended Learning Outcomes

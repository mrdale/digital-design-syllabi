<!-- Rationale for changes: This Class has changed significantly. While Sass remains, jQuery has been deprecated and GIT and Responsive have been folded into CS 251. In the place of the removed content we offer Webpack, Tailwind, and an intro to Wordpress CMS
-->

#### Description
Dev-tooling allows web developers to offload much of the routine, tedious work of code optimization, file preparation and deployment to an intelligent, automatic workflow. Students optimize and deploy websites by configuring and maintaining dev-tooling pipelines. Style preprocessors and frameworks accelerate the creation and simplify the maintenance of design systems. Students construct design systems for web sites by extending CSS with style preprocessors and frameworks. Content Management Systems (CMS) allow websites to be managed by a web-based centralized interface. Students configure a website using popular CMS platforms.

- Understand the basics of Node Package Manager (NPM) and node modules

- Build responsive design systems that utilize a preprocessor and/or atomic-css.
- Replicate existing websites using comprehensive dev-tooling, pre/post preprocessing and atomic-css
- Install and administer a Content Management System to manage a website

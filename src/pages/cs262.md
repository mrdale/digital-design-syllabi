<!-- Rationale for changes: This Class has changed significantly. While Sass remains, jQuery has been deprecated and GIT and Responsive have been folded into CS 251. In the place of the removed content we offer Webpack, Tailwind, and an intro to Wordpress CMS

GRISMER: Think of a good name for this collection... See if you can improve on "Dev-Tooling, frameworks and CMS basics"

CHAPMAN:
A broad course that allows use to pivot while not locking us into aspect of current design technologies

Names that come to mind

1. Productivity Technologies in Web Design

2. Development Experience Technologies and CMS Basics

3. DevX Technologies and CSM Basics

4. Development Experience Tools and CMS Basics

5. Development Tool Frameworks and CMS Basics

CHAPMAN: I view most of these as development experiance tools, style preprocessors/postprocessors, frameworks and other tools are
mainly development experiance tools. They only function to imporove the workflows of designers.

DevTooling doesn't change that you could manually code all the content, it just would not be productive in contrast to the usage of said tools.
These tools will also change over time and the course should be able to pivot into those.
DevTooling is just a Productivity Technology. Maybe focus on the area of that general technolgy?
-->

#### Description

<!-- CHAPMAN: I was considering something like this?
 Productivity Technologies in Web Design is an intermediate-level web development course focusing on the design of responsive interfaces using development experiance workflow tools for designer productivity. Students will learn usage of development experiance design tools; from style pre and post processors, production code minifiers, introduction to frameworks & libraries for building user interfaces, and and introduction to CMS in workflows.
 -->

Dev-tooling allows web developers to offload much of the routine, tedious work of code optimization, file preparation and deployment to an intelligent, automatic workflow. Students optimize and deploy websites by configuring and maintaining dev-tooling pipelines. Style preprocessors and frameworks accelerate the creation and simplify the maintenence of design systems. Students construct design systems for web sites by extending CSS with style preprocessors and frameworks. Content Management Systems (CMS) allow websites to be managed by a web-based centralized interface. Students configure a website using popular CMS platforms.

<!-- Responsive Web Design is an intermediate-level web development course focusing on the design of interfaces that respond intelligently to a wide variety of device limitations. Students will learn the coding methods and technologies required to create adaptable web site designs and practice building fluid interfaces that effectively convey a given message regardless of a user device size and type. Prerequisites: CS 220, BUS 261, CS 251, CS 140 or instructor permission. -->

#### Intended Learning Outcomes

- Utilize a version control system to manage a codebase
- Understand the basics of Node Package Manager (NPM) and node modules
- Create and configure a custom dev-tooling workflow with a [Bundling technology?]
<!-- I would nt want to lock into a bundling technology, the main purpose is to bundle JavaScript
files for usage in a browser. "Code and Asset Bundler System"-->
- Build responsive design systems that utilize a preprocessor and/or atomic-css.
- Replicate exisiting websites using comprehensive dev-tooling, style-preprocessing and atomic-css
<!-- Webpack Bable SASS and other webpack plugins can be viewed as pre and post processing -->
- Install and administer a Content Managment System to manage a website

#### Course Topics

- Version control (GIT)
- CSS Preporcessors with SASS
- Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Webpack
- Atomic CSS with Tailwind
- Website Replication
- Content Management Systems with Wordpress

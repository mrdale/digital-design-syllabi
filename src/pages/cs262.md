<!-- Rationale for changes: This Class has changed significantly. While Sass remains, jQuery has been deprecated and GIT and Responsive have been folded into CS 251. In the place of the removed content we offer Webpack, Tailwind, and an intro to Wordpress CMS
GRISMER: Think of a good name for this collection... See if you can improve on "Style preprocessing, Frameworks, Dev-Tooling and CMS basics

CHAPMAN:
A broad course that allows use to pivot while not locking us into aspect of current design technologies
1. Productivity Technologies in Web Design
2. Development Experience Technologies and CMS Introduction
3. DevX Technologies and CSM Introduction
4. Development Experience Tools and CMS Introduction
5. Development Tool Frameworks and CMS Introduction

CHAPMAN: I view most of these as development experiance tools, style preprocessors/postprocessors, frameworks and other tools are
mainly development experiance tools. They only function to imporove the workflows of designers.
WebTooling doesn't change that you could manually code all the content, it just would not be productive in contrast to the usage of said tools.
These tools will also change over time and the course should be able to pivot into those.

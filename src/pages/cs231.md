<!-- Rationale for changes: To remove specificity to one particular programming language while retaining the broad App building () goal of this class.
 GRISMER: This description is way too specific to .Net. We need to rewrite it to be more generic so it can be applied to our situation. Alternately we could create an entirely new class. **Either way could you take a bash at writing a description, outcomes and topics** -->

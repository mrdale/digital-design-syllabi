<!-- Rationale for changes: To remove specificity to one particular programming language while retaining the broad App building () goal of this class.
 GRISMER: This description is way too specific to .Net. We need to rewrite it to be more generic so it can be applied to our situation. Alternately we could create an entirely new class. **Either way could you take a bash at writing a description, outcomes and topics** -->
#### Description
Students will create an application using an application project-based approach, utilizing and implementing system design, programming and database skills taught in prior classes. ~~(A key class for this project is CS 233 - Asp.Net Programming, as it will assist with the skills needed for the project.)~~ Students are also required to provide a project data model and schedule using the development life cycle. The project must be completed by the end of the spring quarter in the CS 232 - Capstone Application Development II class.

*Recommended:* Recommended course sequence: CS 233, CS 231, CS 232 or instructor permission to register for CS 231

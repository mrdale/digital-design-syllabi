#### Description

Students learn the fundamentals of object orientated programming in JavaScript (JS). Students apply an understanding of JS syntax, data structures, logic and dataflow to capture, process and transform user interactions in webapages. Students build projects using nodeJS, JS APIs and JS native modules in a cohesive codebase.
#### Intended Learning Outcomes

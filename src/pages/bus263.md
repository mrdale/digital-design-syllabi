#### Description
This course focuses on Adobe Photoshop, the industry-standard photo-editing application used in the field of graphic design. Students learn to correct, enhance and transform pixel-based images using Adobe Photoshop. Students apply non-destructive editing where possible while combining multiple images by making complex, nuanced, and accurate selections and managing layers. Students correct images using retouching tools. Students simulate traditional art media by using the mixer brush tool and applying filers. **Formerly CS 223, EMRK 223.**

Students will learn how to create illustrations and graphic elements using paths, shapes, bezier curves, strokes, fills, blends, gradients and type. Students will learn how to manage groups, layers symbols and compound paths and how to apply filters and tranformations. Students will learn how to create complex illustrations by breaking down a given subject into component shapes, determining the relevant tools and techniques needed, then utilyze these tools to complete the design.

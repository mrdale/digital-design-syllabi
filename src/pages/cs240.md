<!-- Rationale for changes: This MCO is too general for a class called Javascript II.
The description should be rewitten to be more specific to advanced topics in JS. This should include algorythm practice and a focus on the NodeJS ecosystem.  -->

#### Description
CS 240 is the second in a series of two courses designed to give students an extension of the current language and an introduction and implementation of data structures including queues, stacks, trees and graphs, using the current programming language. Topics include iterative and recursive implementations. Prerequisite: Grade of C or higher in CS 140. Recommended: CS 121.

<!-- Rationale for changes: This MCO is too general for a class called Javascript II.
GRISMER: I have done some tinkering here, and not to the description: Do you want to give it some magic, to be more specific to advanced topics in JS. This should include algorythm practice and a focus on the Node.js ecosystem. -->

#### Description

Students learn the fundamentals of algorithm data structures within JavaScript (JS) and Node.js. Students build template assembled web pages, store and retrieve site information from databases, and build RestFul API endpoints. Students will perform data handling of forms, usage of middleware, and user authentication.

#### Intended Learning Outcomes

- Create industry-grade JavaScript code using common design patterns
- Use basic data structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues, and trees (optional)
- Use of common sorting and searching algorithms: graphs, hash tables, heaps, linked-lists, queues, sets, stacks
- Use Node.js to create server-based JavaScript applications
- Understand how npm is used to manage Node.js applications
- Create web application servers using Express.js

#### Course Topics

- Review of OOP principles
- Review of FP principles
- Asynchronous design patterns
- Commonly use data sorting Algorithm
  - Graphs, Hash tables, Heaps, Linked-lists, Queues, Sets, Stacks
  - Basic Algorithm performance: O(n), O(log n), O(1)
  - Algorithm modeling in Node.js Ecosystem
- Code review of arrays, lists, stacks, and queues
- Node.js
  - Modules
  - Asynchronous patterns
  - Events
  - Simple HTTP Server
- Express.js
  - Server-side rendered application with templates
  - API RESTful endpoints
  - Server routing
  - Middleware design patterns
  - Authentication Methods
    <!-- - JWT, Passport, Cookies, and other framework methods -->

<!-- #### Description

CS 240 is the second in a series of two courses designed to give students an extension of the current language and an introduction and implementation of data structures including queues, stacks, trees and graphs, using the current programming language. Topics include iterative and recursive implementations. Prerequisite: Grade of C or higher in CS 140. Recommended: CS 121.

#### Intended Learning Outcomes

- Contrast the concept of structured programming against Object Oriented Programming (OOP).  -->
<!--???? -->
<!-- Cobol vs. C++ Langauge type contrast-->
<!-- - Design programs using the concepts of structured programming.
- Develop algorithms to solve complex problems
- Manipulate arrays, structures, stacks, and queues
- Explain and classify the different classes within OOP
- Demonstrate sorting and searching methods
- Design higher order functions
- Understand and utilyze ES6 through ESnow syntax additions
- Use a transpiler  -->
<!-- ???? -->
<!-- Webpack Babel: Automated conversion of code into older syntax, or language to language -->
<!-- - Test JavaScript in the Browser
- Analyze JavaScript in Node.js

#### Course Topics

- OOP principles
- Debugging JS in the browser.
- Advanced Functions
  - Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
  - Callback functions
  - Bind
  - Curry
- Asynchronous execution
  - Promises, try and catch
  - Await
  - Timers
  - Prototypal Inheritance
  - Closures
- JavaScript Design Patterns, Object Creation Patterns, and Code Reuse Patterns

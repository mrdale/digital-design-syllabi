<!-- Rationale for changes: This MCO is too general for a class called Javascript II.
GRISMER: I have done some tinkering here, and not to the description: Do you want to give it some magic, to be more specific to advanced topics in JS. This should include algorythm practice and a focus on the NodeJS ecosystem.



#### Description
Students learn the fundamentals of algorithm data structures within JavaScript (JS) and nodeJS. Students build non-static web pages using basic database interfaces, build server routing, and authentication. Students will conceive of data handling for froms, usage of middleware, persistence of data, and server routing in secure RESTful applcations.

#### Intended Learning Outcomes
	Create industry-grade JavaScript code using common design patterns
	Use basic data structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues, and trees (optional)
	Develop common sorting and searching algorithms: graphs, hash tabls, heaps, linked-lists, queues, sets, stacks
	Use Node.js to create server-based JavaScript applications
	Understand how npm is used to manage Node.js applications
	Create web application servers using Express.js

#### Course Topics
	Review of OOP principles
	Review of FP principles
	Asynchronous design patterns
	Code review of arrays, lists, stacks, and queues
	Node.js
  o	Modules
  o	Asynchronous patterns
  o	Events
  o	Simple HTTP Server
	Express.js
  o	Server-side rendered application with templates
  o	API RESTful endpoints
  o	Authentication and Security
  o	Middle-ware design pattern

#### Description

CS 240 is the second in a series of two courses designed to give students an extension of the current language and an introduction and implementation of data structures including queues, stacks, trees and graphs, using the current programming language. Topics include iterative and recursive implementations. Prerequisite: Grade of C or higher in CS 140. Recommended: CS 121.

#### Intended Learning Outcomes

- Contrast the concept of structured programming against Object Oriented Programming (OOP). <!--???? -->
<!-- Cobol vs. C++ Langauge contrast-->
- Design programs using the concepts of structured programming.
- Develop algorithms to solve complex problems
- Manipulate arrays, structures, stacks, and queues
- Explain and classify the different classes within OOP
- Demonstrate sorting and searching methods
- Design higher order functions
- Understand and utilyze ES6 through ESnow syntax additions
- Use a transpiler <!-- ???? -->
<!-- Webpack Babel: Automated conversion of code into older syntax, or language to language -->
- Test JavaScript in the Browser
- Analyze JavaScript in NodeJS

#### Course Topics

- OOP principles
- Debugging JS in the browser.
- Advanced Functions
  - Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
  - Callback functions
  - Bind
  - Curry
- Asynchronous execution
  - Promises, try and catch
  - Await
  - Timers
  - Prototypal Inheritance
  - Closures
- JavaScript Design Patterns, Object Creation Patterns, and Code Reuse Patterns
- Code Minification and Compression, Loading Strategies, and Dependency Management
- First-class and higher order functions in coding practices
- Functional programming techniques to your JavaScript projects

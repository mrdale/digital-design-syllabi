#### Diversity & Inclusion Statement
WWCC strives to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.
Furthermore, instructors strive to help create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.).

**To help accomplish this:**
* If you use a name and/or pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please let your instructor know.

* If you feel that your learning is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please reach out or talk with your instructor or advisor. We want to be a resource for you.

* We are continuously in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to your instructor about it or reach out to the Office of Equity, Diversity & Inclusion.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional, and they can contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals or groups at the college. If you experience or observe unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity, we encourage you to speak out for justice and support. To report an incident or access support and resources, contact the Office of Equity, Diversity & Inclusion, [equity@wwcc.edu](equity@wwcc.edu), 509-527-4300.
